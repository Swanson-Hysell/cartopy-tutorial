nomenclature}\label{map-projections-reference-systems-and-other-geospatial-nomenclature}}

This text is modified from a tutorial on working with geospatial data
using the library \texttt{cartopy} that was presented at the 2018 Scipy
conference by Phileas Elson:

    \hypertarget{purpose}{%
\subsection{Purpose}\label{purpose}}

The purpose of this document is to give you a bit of a background on map
projections, reference systems and other geospatial terms. This will
help you to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  choose map projections that are appropriate for plotting data
\item
  understand the terms used in the \texttt{cartopy} functions which is a
  function library we will use for plotting geospatial data
\end{itemize}

``Azimuthal equidistant projections of the sphere \ldots{} have been
co-opted as images of the flat Earth model, depicting Antarctica as an
ice wall surrounding a disk-shaped Earth.''

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Most of our media for visualization

Our two most common media are flat:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Paper
\item
  Screen

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{But there are \emph{a few} that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  3D rendering engine (the engine is then typically responsible for
  projecting the data to 2D for presentation to screen)
\item
  A Spherical Projector\ldots{}

\subsection{{[}Map{]} Projections: Taking us from spherical to
flat}\label{map-projections-taking-us-from-spherical-to-flat}}

A map projection (or more commonly refered to as just ``projection'')
is:

\begin{quote}
a systematic transformation of the latitudes and longitudes of locations
from the surface of a sphere or an ellipsoid into locations on a plane.
{[}\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection}{Wikipedia: Map
projection}{]}.
\end{quote}

    \hypertarget{the-major-problem-with-map-projections}{%
\subsection{The major problem with map
projections}\label{the-major-problem-with-map-projections}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The surface of a sphere is topologically different to a 2D surface,
  therefore we \emph{have} to cut the sphere \emph{somewhere}
\item
  A sphere's surface cannot be represented on a plane without
  distortion.
\end{itemize}

    \hypertarget{different-projections}{%
\subsubsection{Different projections}\label{different-projections}}

We are going to use the function library \texttt{cartopy} to make maps.
\texttt{cartopy} supports a number of different map projections which
enable the 3 dimensional surface of Earth to be shown in 2 dimensions on
our computer screens. I (Nick Swanson-Hysell) like the Robinson
projection -- you can see what the says about me by referring to this
comic:

Check out the list of projections supported by \texttt{cartopy}

    \hypertarget{common-distortions-of-map-projections}{%
\subsubsection{Common distortions of map
projections}\label{common-distortions-of-map-projections}}

Properties of maps that are often not preserved:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Area
\item
  Shape
\item
  Direction
\item
  Distance
\item
  Scale
\end{itemize}

Two common approaches:

Downside: Not all projections can be classified in this way
-\textgreater{} Leads to big ``pseudo'' and ``other'' groups.

Downside: Some projections can live in multiple groups.

    \hypertarget{preserving-metric-conformal}{%
\subsection{Preserving metric:
Conformal}\label{preserving-metric-conformal}}

Also known as Orthomorphic.

These projections preserve angles locally. Implying that circles
anywhere on the Earth's surface map to circles of \emph{varying size} in
the projected space.

Examples of conformal projections:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mercator
\item
  Transverse Mercator
\item
  Stereographic
\item
  Lambert conformal conic
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{use-in-large-scale-maps-zoomed-in}{%
\subsubsection{Use in large scale maps (zoomed

Often used to preserve shape to represent their physical counterpart.
Seamless online maps like OSM/Google/Bing use a Mercator projection:

\begin{quote}
The first launch of {[}Google{]} Maps actually did not use Mercator, and
streets in high latitude places like Stockholm did not meet at right
angles on the map the way they do in reality.
{[}\href{https://productforums.google.com/d/msg/maps/A2ygEJ5eG-o/KbZr_B0h2hkJ}{ref}{]}
\end{quote}

The major drawback: it is difficult to compare lengths or areas

\hypertarget{use-in-small-scale-maps-zoomed-out}{%
\subsubsection{Use in small scale maps (zoomed
out)}\label{use-in-small-scale-maps-zoomed-out}}

Maps reflecting directions, such as an {[}aero{]}nautical chart, or
whose gradients are important, such as a weather maps, are often
projected by conformal projections.

Historically, many world maps are drawn by conformal projections, but
the fact that the scale of the map varies by location makes it difficult
to compare lengths or areas. Some have gone as far as calling the
Mercator projection imperialistic and racist.

    \hypertarget{preseving-metric-equidistant}{%
\subsection{Preseving metric:
Equidistant}\label{preseving-metric-equidistant}}

No map projection can be universally equidistant.

Some projections preserve distance from some standard point or line.

Examples of projections that preserve distances along meridians (but not
parallels):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Equirectangular / Plate Carree
\item
  Azimuthal equidistant
\end{itemize}

    \hypertarget{preseving-metric-equal-area}{%
\subsection{Preseving metric:
Equal-area}\label{preseving-metric-equal-area}}

Equal-area maps preserve area measure, generally distorting shapes in
order to do so.

Examples of equal area projections: * Albers conic * Eckert IV * Goode's
homolosine * Lambert azimuthal equal-area * Lambert cylindrical
equal-area * Sinusoidal

    \hypertarget{preseving-metric-compromise}{%
\subsection{Preseving metric:
Compromise}\label{preseving-metric-compromise}}

Rather than perfectly preserving any metric properties, compromise
projections aim strike a balance between distortions. These compromises
are often at the cost of polar distortions.

Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Miller
\item
  Robinson
\item
  Winkel Tripel
\end{itemize}

    \hypertarget{tissots-indicatrix}{%
\subsection{Tissot's indicatrix}\label{tissots-indicatrix}}

A mathematical contrivance in order to characterize local distortions of
a map projection. Multiple circles (on the sphere/ellipse) of constant
area are drawn on the map. By analysing the distortions, we can identify
(or more often rule-out) particular preserving metrics. You can see how
dramatic the distortion is in an equirectangular projection.
